    <h1 class="h1">Blog Maksym Istomin 6-A</h1>
    <h2 class="h2">Hello, my name is Maksym Istomin and I live in Mykolayiv. 
        I like travelling very much and I want to tell you something about it.
        Most of all I like my trip to <a href="https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/12/c1/54/f3/selectum-luxury-resort.jpg?w=700&h=-1&s=1">Turkey</a>. There’s a very beautiful sea and excellent service in hotels. There were a lot of swimming-pools in our hotel and a football field. Every day in the evening I played football with other guys, who also lived in that hotel. 
        I also visited <a href="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62200394843406293f033f05/62ccac238cf05dedc2d390be_62bc3acc88aa276f7dc2b17c_krk-island-croatia.jpeg">Croatia</a>, <a href="https://img.flytrippers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/27115816/best-places-montenegro.png">Montenegro</a>, <a href="https://www.myglobalviewpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Most-Beautiful-Places-in-Greece-Featured-Image.jpg">Greece</a> and <a href="https://i.natgeofe.com/k/11c64d9e-7baa-44af-8589-726fcfef3f7c/egypt-pyramids.jpg?w=1084.125&h=609">Egypt</a>. When we where in Egypt, we had an excursion to <a href="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a87961cbe42d637c54cab93/9888e2b2-abc0-4b48-ad11-5292e1b97ffc/dead-sea-israel-travel-guide.jpg">Israel</a>. I was very impressed by this trip, because I visited the <a href="https://azbyka.ru/palomnik/images/thumb/b/bc/%D0%A5%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC_%D0%A0%D0%BE%D0%B6%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B0_%D0%A5%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0_%D0%B2_%D0%92%D0%B8%D1%84%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B5.jpg/1200px-%D0%A5%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC_%D0%A0%D0%BE%D0%B6%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B0_%D0%A5%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0_%D0%B2_%D0%92%D0%B8%D1%84%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B5.jpg">birth place of Jesus Christ</a>. I also visited the <a href="https://www.americaisraeltours.com/israel-travel-guide/wp-content/uploads/jor1.jpg">Jordan river</a>. It was very cold.
        I really like the views in Croatia and Montenegro. There are very beautiful mountains and fantastic nature. 
        In Greece I also really like our hotel, because it is one of the best in this resort. There was very tasty food. We could also rent a car for free in our hotel. There was a lot of different entertainments, such as tennis, football, chess, concerts etc. 
        I also was in many European   countries. Most of all I liked Vienna, Budapest, Munich and Krakow. These cities have very beautiful architecture. For example, the most beautiful building in Budapest is the <a href="https://www.parlament.hu/documents/2833802/0/Kurka+G%C3%A9za+%40+Photogeza+Parlamant+k%C3%A9pei15.jpg/1cf926b7-7665-a0d4-b039-23592b539493?t=1652948829188">Budapest Parliament</a>, in <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Wien_-_Schloss_Sch%C3%B6nbrunn.JPG">Vienna – Schönbrunn</a>. The <a href="https://subscription.ukrweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/Bandera-grave.jpg">grave of Stepan Bandera</a> is located in Munich. What I remember most about Krakow was the trip to the <a href="https://cdn.britannica.com/38/181338-050-702E01DC/Freight-train-tracks-Auschwitz-Birkenau-Nazi-Germany-Oswiecim.jpg">Auschwitz concentration camp</a>. I can’t say that I really liked this place, but I think that everyone should visit it. People should not forget what terrible things happened and this story mustn’t be repeated. 
        
        I hope my story was interesting and useful to you.</h2>
